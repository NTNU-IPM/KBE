      <p>This thesis studies how Knowledge-Based Engineering concepts can be used to <em>i_automate tasks in the mechanism design process, and _ii</em> support and enable the use of design optimization. </p>

<p>The pilot implementation of a mechanism system has been reviewed and further developed in the Adaptive Modeling Language. Domain knowledge in the areas of mechanisms, Finite Element Analysis and design optimization, is captured, modeled and used for automation in the mechanism design process. Through simple user input a parametrized model including links, joints, springs, dampers, loads, and subsequent multi-point constraints, is created. The model is used to establish an interface with AML and the analysis software FEDEM. The interface provides the basis for including structural analyses in a fully automated design optimization.</p>

<p>The system enables a wide range of mechanisms to be automatically modeled, pre-processed and analysed, thereby demonstrating how routine design work in the mechanism design process, can be reduced. </p>
